# About Me

## Application Developer

Sunit is a polygot Application Developer, currently working at Citicorp Services (CSIL). *I have worked in ThoughtWorks, India for 8+ years prior to taking up job at Citibank.* My experience includes using Java, Ruby and Scala to develop complex enterprise applications and large-scale websites. Apart from architecting solutions, I have done coaching on agile practices like TDD, Refactoring, Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery.

I am passionate about learning new technologies and using them to solve complex business problems. I have contributed to 2 Open Source projects - **[Data Anonyization](http://sunitparekh.github.io/data-anonymization/)** a tool that builds anonymized production data to use for performance and security testing, debugging production issues and development purposes, and **[soupCMS](http://www.soupcms.com)** an unobtrusive and light-weight CMS framework build using Ruby.
