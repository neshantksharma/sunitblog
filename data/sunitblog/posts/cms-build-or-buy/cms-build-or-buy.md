Now days every business wants CMS capability in their sites, at minimum for single page sites to build. On each and every project I have been on in last 5 odd years, CMS was part of application in one or the other way. At the start of the project I always had to think and decide which CMS system should I go for. And working with different domain, some patterns started emerging in my thoughts and helped me making decision.
