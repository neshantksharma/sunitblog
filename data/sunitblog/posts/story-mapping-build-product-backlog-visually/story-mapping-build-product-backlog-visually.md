Story mapping is effective tool to visually create product backlog in a structure way, which helps with building common understanding, brainstorming, prioritising and release planning activities during inception[^inception].

During project inception one of the key objective is to collect requirements collaboratively. It is challenging to capture requirement that is, visually available in front of eyes and not buried inside documents. Also it is difficult to decide where to start and what to focus on.

Story mapping is top down approach of requirement gathering and represents a tree structure. Story mapping starts from vision, vision is achieved by user completing goals, goals are completed by doing activities and to do activities user needs to perform tasks. And these tasks can be transformed into user stories for software development.

> Story Map Structure: **Goals > Activities > Tasks > Stories**

Lets take an example of one goal from 'Online Store' to understand above structure better,

![online store story map](ref:images:posts/story-mapping-build-product-backlog-visually/story-mapping-build-product-backlog-visually.png){: .full-width}

Another alternative structure based on 'User Journeys' that works well is **User > Goals > User Journeys > Actions > Stories**. User driven approach helps to identify requirements from user perspective e.g. buyer, seller, administrator etc.

## Define story mapping structure

In story mapping, defining structure is important and define it as needed. Objective is to start with some structure in mind and evolve it. Sometime it takes 2-3 iteration to get the structure right. Following are two examples used in defining product backlog on a real projects,

For functional requirements using 4 levels **Goals > Features > Epics > Story**.

and for non-functional requirement using 3 levels **Feature > Epic > Story**.

> Large project requires upto 6 levels in story mapping. However for small project 3 levels are good enough.

## Enrich story map with more information

1. Use different colors to represent different levels in story map e.g. Orange for Goals, Blue for Features, Green for Epics and Yellow for Stories.
2. Put wireframe next to the relevant area of story map.
3. Use stickers like dots or stars to present special notations
  * Marking *Out of Scope* features are important for shared understanding
  * Identifying *alternatives* help to capture rich user experience and low cost alternative solutions
4. Use small sticky to capture notes, assumption, follow-ups or questions

## Advantages of story mapping

1. Visual presentation of the product backlog (big picture), bringing all the stakeholders on same page with project understanding and scope. Indirectly provides a view of project size.
2. Requirements captured in physical format fosters collaboration and discussions.
3. Story map tree structure helps with prioritisation and easy in slicing of backlog into releases.
4. Stories on the wall assists team to do relative sizing of the stories together by looking at the story map and marking all similar stories with same size.
5. Considering inception a time boxed duration, story map approach helps to deep dive and focus on important features of the application in priority order. Marking 'nice to have' features as 'out of scope' during deep dive sessions, team avoids spending time on not so important stuff.


## Preparing for story mapping exercise

1. Conference room with large wall space for full duration of inception. Clear everything near walls to have more walking space.
2. Different color stickies (minimum 4 colors). Remove stickies carefully to avoid folds and fall down, so it stays on wall for whole duration of inception and readable in photos.
3. Thick marker pens (1.5mm thick permanent marker) 10+ nos - to read stickies from little far and in photos
4. Some marking stickers (dots or stars) - to mark stickies and enrich story map with more information
5. Use [magic charts/whiteboard](http://www.magicwhiteboard.co.uk/category/magic-whiteboard/) in case walls are not good surface for stickies
6. Good camera to take photos of the wall

Story mapping was introduced to me by [Chirag](https://twitter.com/chiragsdoshi) almost 5 years back and I find it very effective and useful tool to capture requirements during inception.

### Footnotes

[^inception]: Inception is time boxed period to understand project vision, collect requirements, size it and prioritise the work to be done . Duration varies from 2 weeks to 4 weeks. Also known as **Project envisioning** or **Project kickoff** phase.
