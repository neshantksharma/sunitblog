Setting up distributed team is very common in new world of software development. However, it is equally important that each team operates in complete autonomy. And there is need for team to be independent and takes ownership. However, everyone has different views and understanding of ownership. I like to define ownership with 3 aspects which can help to build common understanding of ownership and eventually help team taking more ownership.   

To answer all of above let's first define, what is ownership and different aspect of ownership. In software development I like to define ownership as 3 pillars - technical, solution and business. Let me elaborate,

![3 Pillars of Ownership for Distributed Teams](ref:images:posts/distributed-team-ownership-model/distributed-team-ownership-model-original.svg "3 Pillars of Ownership for Distributed Teams")

1. **Technical ownership** means delivering quality code by following engineering practices such as coding, refactoring, continuous integration, build and deployment etc. along with full autonomy is in my view is technical ownership. Technical ownership also includes owning technical decisions including architecture and design patterns for software development. 
 
2. **Solution ownership** is about providing solutions to solve business problems. e.g. a) for retail website building recommendation engine based on what use is looking for, b) to achieve mobile first build UX/UI with responsive web design approach. Solution also involves how we can deliver the feature e.g. define MVP and roll out as first cut to end users and with each release keep enhancing the feature as needed. This approach is also known as lean software development which required better project planning and tracking skills.  
 
3. **Business ownership** involves working closely with business in defining business needs and helping in building solution to solve the problem. e.g. on retail website defining the reward scheme and to promote mobile applications give more reward.  

In my view each of above can have maturity levels within. In **technical ownership** delivering good quality code could be the first step and reaching continuous delivery with automated build and deployment could be the highest maturity level. For **solution ownership** deciding appropriate technology to solve the problem is first and coming up with full plan on how to deliver the solution is highest level of maturity. The most tricky one is **business ownership** where it is very difficult to define what is expected. However, best way to judge is, Is business calling you to discuss and define requirements. If yes, you are there. 
 
Now, it is important to understand, what is expected as well as what is desired by the team. In distributed team, team should have specific roles to achieve each type of ownership. Developers, QAs and BAs can help achieve Technical ownership. However, without Tech Leads and Project/Program Managers is is difficult to achieve Solution leadership. Similarly we need Product Owners and Senior BAs to achieve Business ownership. *So it is important for the stakeholders to setup team based on what is expected from the team.*  
 
Each type of ownership pillars are independent form each other. Each type of ownership can be achieved individually based on what is desired and expected from the team. And team can have different maturity level in different ownership pillars. Also to make team fully autonomous and independent, all of 3 pillars are important.
